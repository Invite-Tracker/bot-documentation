## Introduction

Invite Tracker is a powerful Discord bot that offers countless amounts of features such as invite and message tracking, giveaways, and just so much more. It is also capable of welcoming new users to your server with a fully customizable join message feature.

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure that Invite Tracker is in the server you are looking to use it in. If not, you may invite it by clicking [here](https://invite.invite-tracker.com/).

Invite Tracker is by default only asking for the permissions required for it to work, we highly recommend that you make sure you are inviting it with the required permissions. Otherwise, the bot may not work properly. If you want to know more details about why we are asking for specific permissions, read the [FAQ](faq.md).

## Configuration

Once Invite Tracker has been invited on your server, if you invited it with the required permissions, it will already begin tracking new invites!

If you are wanting to jump right into having Invite Tracker announce new members, you would want to check out Invite Tracker's [_join, join DM, and leave message_](invite-tracker/dashboard/join-join-dm-and-leave-messages/) features.
