## Creating a Giveaway

To start creating a giveaway, simply click the big blue button that says _**Create Giveaway**_. This will make another menu pop up.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/GiveawayOverview.png)

At first glance, it might look like a lot of very complicated stuff but do not worry. We will go through everything.

### Prize Name, Number of Winners, and Channel

* **Prize Name** is what you want to call your giveaway. We recommend you include the prize of the giveaway in the name.
* **Number of Winners** is where you insert how many winners you want for your giveaway. Invite Tracker will select the specified amount of winners when the giveaway ends.
* **Channel** is where you configure which channel you want the giveaway to be sent in. Simply click the box and choose the channel.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">The maximum length of your prize name is only 190 characters.</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">The maximum amount of winners you can have without premium is 20 and with premium is 100.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### End Date

The first box under **End Date** is where you configure what day you want the giveaway to end. The format, as shown in the box, is `mm/dd/yyyy`. You can also click the little calendar icon on the right side of the box to display an interactive calendar which you can use to choose the day you want the giveaway to end.

The second box is where you configure at what time you want the giveaway to end. It uses a 24-hour clock format. You can also click the little clock icon on the right side of the box to display an interactive time selector which you can use to choose the time you want the giveaway to end.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">The giveaway ends at the configured time in your time zone.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">Free server giveaways can last up to one month.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">Premium server giveaways can last up to three months.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The maximum end date without premium is 1 month and with premium is 3 months.
{% endhint %}

### Role Assignment

* **Required Roles** allows you to choose between "All roles required" versus "Only one role required" meaning the user needs to have all the roles selected or just one of the roles.
* **Bonus Entry Roles** are all awarded a specified amount of bonus entries to the giveaway. Users with these roles have an increased chance of winning the giveaway.
* <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Winner Roles** are roles that are given to the winner(s) of the giveaway.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">Remember to add the number of bonus entries given to each role when assigning bonus entry roles.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">The maximum amount of required roles, bonus entry roles, and winner roles you can have is 10 and with premium you may have up to 30 bonus entry roles.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Required Messages

Required messages are pretty self-explanatory. In order to join the giveaway, you need to have the required number of messages sent in the server.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/GiveawayRow4.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">Only numbers can go here to set the number of messages you want to require to be able to enter the giveaway. If the number of messages required is not met, it will not allow you to enter the giveaway.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### An example of a Giveaway

Below is an example of what the giveaway creation process will look like. In this giveaway, both "Verified" and "Role 1" roles are required to enter. The "Server Booster" role is set to have 5 bonus entries if the user has that role and the "Reward A" role will be awarded to the winner of the giveaway (Winner roles are a premium feature). Lastly, the number of messages required to enter the giveaway is 50.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/GiveawaySample (1).png>)

Now we just hit the blue button at the bottom of the page named **Create giveaway** and the giveaway should be made in the configured channel. If not, check [Invite Tracker's permissions](../../faq.md#what-are-the-required-permissions-for-invite-tracker) first.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/GiveawaySampleDC.png)

Now that we have an active giveaway, we can go back to the dashboard and see that it has been added to the list of the server's active giveaways.

## <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Editing a Giveaway

To edit a giveaway, just click the _**Blue Pencil**_ button. This will show almost the exact same menu as the giveaway creation menu.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/GiveawaySampleEdit.png)

From here you can edit anything you like and after you save, Invite Tracker will make the necessary changes to the giveaway in the server.

For our giveaway, we will increase the required number of messages up to 100 from 50.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/GiveawaySampleEditMR.png)

Now you can just go ahead and click _**Edit giveaway**_. Now if you check your server, you will be able to see that the giveaway has changed.
