# Premium

## What is Invite Tracker Premium?

Invite Tracker Premium, as you may have already guessed, is the premium version of Invite Tracker. Invite Tracker Premium increases your already massive pool of features by giving you even more to use and utilize. Invite Tracker Premium not only gives you new features to use but also increases the limits on many other free features.

## Why are we even taking payment for some features?

You may wonder why we are even offering a premium version of Invite Tracker in the first place. Well, Invite Tracker requires a lot of CPU and RAM resources to run perfectly 24/7 but to achieve this, it needs to be hosted on a dedicated server for which we are charged a monthly fee. In addition to the bills, Invite Tracker is constantly being updated with new features, which when added together with the amount of maintenance needed, obviously craves a lot of our time. Subscribing to Invite Tracker Premium is the best way you can help and support us in Invite Tracker's development.
