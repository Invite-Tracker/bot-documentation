## Copying IDs

IDs are special "codes" that are different for all users, channels, and messages. An ID of something is what most bots use to find and locate that specific user, message, channel, role, or server. Invite Tracker has a few features where IDs are necessary. If you want to know how to copy the different main ID types, please keep reading. Remember to have turned Developer Mode on, or else copying IDs will not be possible.
